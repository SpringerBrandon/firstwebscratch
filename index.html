				<article class="left">
					<p>
						I worked in IT and around computers for approximately seven years before I decided to try something different. By different I mean I that tried out utility technician, high voltage electrician (lineman), and semi-truck driver.  However, they never gave me the same sense of satisfaction as being able to create brand new things out of basically nothing the way you can with IT. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						As a student at Thinkful, I love that I can go at my own pace and none of the content is time-gated!  This is super important since I've always felt other courses were paced a little too slow.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						My professional interests include:
						<ul>
							<li>Automation</li>
							<li>Scripting</li>
							<li>Coding</li>
							<li>Gaming</li>
						</ul>

			<!-- Personal about me section-->
				<article class="right">
					<p>
						As stated above, I really like skydiving and am working on getting my jump cert to be able to jump anywhere in the US without a tandem (someone attached to you).
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						I also am very interested in woodworking and have multiple projects lined up to build various pieces of furniture from a new office desk to a pergola for my backyard.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Just like most people that are interested in computers, I'm very interested in gaming.  This is actually a big part of me wanting to learn to code is so that I can use my free time to make some mods or something else cool!
					</p>

						My personal interest include:
						<ol>
							<li>Gaming</li>
							<li>Woodworking</li>
							<li>Hockey</li>
							<li>Skydiving</li>
