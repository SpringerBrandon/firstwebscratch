					<p>
						I worked in IT and around computers for approximately seven years before I decided to try something different. By different I mean I that tried out utility technician, high voltage electrician (lineman), and semi-truck driver.  However, they never gave me the same sense of satisfaction as being able to create brand new things out of basically nothing the way you can with Web Development. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Most of those jobs I tried out have you working by yourself as well - especially driving the truck.  While most people can agree it's nice to do your own thing, coming together with a team to make the best possible product just keeps you motivated and innovative as well.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						As a student at Thinkful, I love that I can go at my own pace and none of the content is time-gated!  This is super important since I've always felt other courses were paced a little too slow.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						My professional interests include:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Automation</li>
							<li>Scripting</li>
							<li>Coding</li>
							<li>Gaming</li>
						</ul>

					<p>
						As stated above, I really like skydiving and am working on getting my jump cert to be able to jump anywhere in the US without a tandem (someone attached to you).  After I get that cert I plan to jump in all 50 states, and maybe branch out to other countries after that!
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						I also am very interested in woodworking and have multiple projects lined up to build various pieces of furniture from a new office desk to a pergola for my backyard.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Just like most people that are interested in computers, I'm very interested in gaming.  This is actually a big part of me wanting to learn to code is so that I can use my free time to make some mods or something else cool, like a web game!
					</p>

						My personal interest include:

						<ol>
							<li>Gaming</li>
							<li>Woodworking</li>
							<li>Hockey</li>
							<li>Skydiving</li>
